1. Crashing, DDoSing, messing with the server is not allowed and it will be punished in a permaban, Just don't do that. I'm okay with you flooding the station, blowing some bombs up, but no 1000 explosions or putting bombs everywhere, because that freezes the server.<br>
2. ERP is not allowed at all. not the slightest bit. Take that somewhere else.<br>
3. Speak proper english or be banned, this is a rule that applies to brazilians mostly.<br>
4. We are not a roleplay/snowflake server (roleplay optional though), If you come into the server and say "this is aids. this is the worst server ever" just because it's not a roleplay server, you will not be respected. And you will be probably banned. Go to paradise. For fuck's sake<br>
