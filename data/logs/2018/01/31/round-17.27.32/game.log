[17:34:35]ADMIN: Noober84555/(THE SECOND COMING OF DAMN DANIEL) has created a command report: What to do if you Overdose with Strattera
You should seek medical attention immediately by going to the nearest emergency room and taking the medication packet with you, and any other packets for other medications you have overdosed with as well.

Once at the hospital, the doctors and nurses will monitor you for signs of problems caused by the overdose. They may pump your stomach if the overdose was recent. They may also give you some charcoal to disrupt the absorption of the excess medication.

There are several ways you can prevent an overdose with Strattera. You can keep a medication diary, and record when you have taken your dose for that day. If you are feeling depressed or suicidal, you could ask a friend or relative to keep hold of your medication and give you your doses. You should see your physician for advice for managing a low mood and suicidal thoughts.

If you have a child who takes Strattera, you can give them their medication so they do not overdose Once again, if they have symptoms of depression or suicidal ideas, you should see your physician as this is a rare side effect of Strattera, and needs to be treated.
